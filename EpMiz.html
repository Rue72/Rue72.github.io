Lily was snacking on a rice lunch, she had received a notice that someone accepted her job posting she left on the adventurer board, a sort of escort job. 
]]Text
She did not have her own funds to pay, however Kane did provide her from the ministry should the job prove a large expense. 
]]Text
In any case, she was waiting at an agreed upon meeting place, which was the lobby in the Shinju palace. 
]]Text
She really had no idea what this person would look like, all she knew was the samurai was well recommended.

A young Raen approached the common area, looking around carefully before making her move.

Arriving at Shinju Palace was a red clad Raen. In her hands was a piece of paper listing a job offer she recently took up, and by her hip was a sleek blade, signaling her samurai status. 
]]Text
She read over the paper as she made her way to the designated meeting spot, wanting to get the details of the mission burned into her memory. 
]]Text
It didn't seem like anything she wasn't used to, a simple escort mission. 
]]Text
It was both reassuring to know that she wouldn't be getting into anything over her head, but a bit dull seeing as it would be the same thing as her previous jobs. 
]]Text
Stepping into the cafeteria her red eyes scanned the room for her patron, eventually resting on a peculiar lavender haired girl sitting alone. 
]]Text
She fit the bill, so it wouldn't hurt to introduce herself. Walking up Mizuki stood to the side of the stranger, giving her a small bow of respect.

The Au Ra remained quiet as Lily spoke, instead letting her eyes speak for her as they flared with excitement. 
]]Text
She's only heard tales of these voidsent, how terrifying and otherworldly they were. She knew they weren't an easy foe to take down, but the knowledge would be invaluable.
]]Text
"Since we are being honest, I've fought man and beast, but never have I encountered a voidsent. I believe I am strong enough to be up to the task, >>"

"I only hope that my inexperience won't put a hamper on us. I ask that you let me prove myself."

The young woman before her beamed of confidence, and that set Lily at ease.

The samurai goes quiet for a moment, thinking over the situation at hand. "What are the chances that those soldiers are still alive. Are the voidsent known to take prisoners, or do they mindlessly kill?"

Being asked a question, Lily unconsciously brushed the hair on her right side back behind and tucked behind her ear. 
]]Text
"Well, you see, voidsent are classified by rungs, like steps on a ladder, the higher the rung, the higher the intelligence and power it has, the lower the rung, the more mindless it is."
]]Text
"All voidsent seek aether of this world, and the most likely encounters are from the lowest rungs, however I have in the past encountered many that seemed intelligent, and wanted to capture me for some purpose..." 
]]Text
She realized she was rambling, she stopped, took a bite of her snack, and then continued "Well, it’s not likely the soldiers are alive."

A sigh of relief escaped Mizuki's lips, thankful that her employer wished to set out tomorrow. She would get ready if needed, but much preferred to take her time."

The pair met up the following morning, and hired a chocobo driver to take them to the nearby mountain village.

The area was densely forested and the lively insect and bird life could be heard everywhere.
]]Text
Dismounting the chocobo carriage, Lily consulted her map together with Mizuki, and they walked along a forested path, no creatures of any sort approached them.
]]Text
There was also no sign of any soldiers in the area, recently or otherwise.

Reaching the cave indicated to her, there was a young Kitsune woman waiting outside the entrance, looking restless. . .

Mizuki was eager and ready to start the day, walking alongside Lily as they made their way towards the mission location. 
]]Text
Despite the peaceful atmosphere, the young Au Ra kept her eyes peeled, surveying the area around them as they walked. 
]]Text
There was no telling what sort of creatures they may run into, be it normal carnivorous fauna, or dastardly voidsent looking to feast on their aether.

The sights and sounds were rather comforting.

 "Do you see that?" She asked, glancing back at the distressed Kitsune. "Is that someone you know?"

Watching the two ladies approach, she was surprised they made their way over to this particular cave, there was precious little inside except.... She quieted her thoughts for a moment. "You can call me Hoshi."

Mizuki's eyes widened as Lily suddenly stepped out and began to approach the stranger, the samurai quickly catching up and taking a few steps ahead of her employer.

Hoshi had a blank expression on her face, as if annoyed by the question. "No, I can’t say that I have, I have only just arrived a few hours ago."

]]Text 
Mizuki stared the girl down, trying to get a read of her body language, hoping to see if she was lying through her teeth or not. 
]]Text
It was a strange coincidence, especially since she supposedly came here often. "What's so special about this cave? What brings you back her so much?" She asks, her hand not moving from her hilt. 
]]Portrait

]]Text 
Looking at the Raen eye to eye. She said flatly. "I sometimes come here to collect flowers, if you are going to go inside, would you collect some for me while you’re in there?"
]]Text
"It’s perfectly safe for you.... to pick them that is, the cave itself is quite dangerous."
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Green_Think
]]Text 
Her expression changed from emotionless to confused, taken aback from the request. "You want me to pick you flowers? I... I mean I guess I can, if I have the time."

"Is there a specific type that you'd like, or is it whatever I can get my hands on?"

"Well, I'll see what I can do for you, but I can't make any promises. We've come here for a different reason, and that takes priority above your flowers."

Lily's eyes met Mizuki's, and then went back to Hoshi, she felt uncomfortable. "...Why again does it matter if we picked any before, you mentioned something about that."

"Well..." Thinking quickly "the flowers, eastern night sage that is, emit a slight..... Allergen. You shouldn’t pick too many."

"Allergies? Like a stuffy nose and puffy eyes? Well even if we gave them to you, the allergens would still affect you too." Her eyes narrowed. "You're not telling the full truth."

]]Text 
Ok fine, The Eastern night sage are covered in very fine spines, and emit indetectable spores, both  of which serve to distribute a faint allergen, slight doses are harmless..."
]]Text
"But after a certain exposure it will provoke a reaction, the spores are only released when the flowers are picked."
]]Portrait

]]Text 
"What sort of reaction happens if you pick too many? And why were you so adamant on hiding that from us? That only wants to make me pick them less!" Mizuki says with a bit of a tone, frowning. 
]]Text
"Besides, what would we even get from doing that for you. What do you have to offer?"
]]Portrait
Hoshi_Standard
]]Text 
"The reaction curdles the blood, surely killing you. Pick only four each, and no more you’ll be fineeeeeee, and just wait a year or so before coming back so the pois-- allergen will fully clear from the blood...."

"Hmm I can offer 100 gil to each of you for this."

"Give me a moment to talk to my partner about this." She says, turning back to Lily and leaning to whisper into her ear.

"As I have said, I am a healer, there is a village nearby, the allergen is for... sleeping"

"Surely there are other remedies than these dangerous flowers. If they're needed for sleep, or pain relief, I'm sure I can find you a much better substitute."

She says to Hoshi, her gut giving her a bad feeling about the situation.

Lily pondered a bit "Wait Miss Kawakami... nothing she has said was a lie, she is just slow to reveal details, surely that can be understood, often times apothecary techniques are viewed as magic after all."

It was quite a lot of money, and Lily was not paid well... she looked again to Mizuki, pondering what to say next.

"Like I said before, I work for you, so you make the final call. If you believe her, and think that picking these flowers is something we can do, then I won't object."

Creatures that called the cave home would occasionally try to make them their next meal, but it was nothing the two couldn't handle, her blade swiftly striking down any attackers.

So far it just seemed like normal, cave dwelling monstrosities, and not voidsent abominations. "How are you holding up?" She asked Lily as they continued to wander.

Mizuki looked to the flower that Lily pointed out, it's soft green glow lighting up a small space of the room. Using her sword, she gently poked the top of the flower, checking to make sure it wasn't booby trapped. 
]]Text
"You think so? Allow me to take the first flower and make sure it's safe." She says before walking forward, grabbing the stem and plucking it from its roots.

Removing a small red orb from her pocket, she spoke to it. “Eva, tell us about this flower.”

A small Allagan Node whirred and beeped, it scanned the flower. And gave a report. "Warning, hazardous agents are present, limit exposure as possible."

Lily patted the node and put it back away in her pocket. "Well, this seems to be the right flower."

Mizuki held out her hand; the flower resting in her palm as the node scanned it. The machination warned of the poisons present within it, yet she didn't feel any different before.

Hopefully it wasn't a silent killer. She tucked the flower away in a safe place, wiping her hands. "So far so good. Let's keep going."

"Will do. You know, Eva would have told us to vacate immediately if there was a danger like that, she is very reliable you know." Lily wandered further into the cave.

"It is bizarre that we haven't seen any. Yet we have ran into a surprising number of local wildlife. Maybe they are moving out from further within the cave to get away from the voidsent?"

Reaching out she plucked it away, gritting her teeth as it's barbs pricked her finger tips.

Considering that thought. "No, I do believe this cave is long abandoned, it makes no sense for voidsent to occupy this area as there is precious little aether for them to feast on here.
]]Text
"Which is all the more reason why if true they are here, then it’s my fault.... Let’s continue"
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Green_Standard
]]Text 
Mizuki gave Lily a bit of a sad look as she got excited over 100 gil. Sure, the Au Ra was born into a better situation than others, but even then, most commoners would have 100 gil on them.

Maybe she would give her half of the share to her employer, if it was that bad.

Before she could contemplate any further on Lily’s situation,  her ears caught the sound of a fast approaching creature, the source coming from one of the nearby tunnels.

Quickly she took a defensive position in front of Lily, holding her ground as the voidsent charged at her.

With eyes closed she took a deep breath in, planting her feet into the ground as her hand hovered over the hilt of her blade, and as the creature drew close, she drew her sword, swiping diagonally in one lightning-fast swipe.

Lily drew her staff as she watched Mizuki take decisive action. 'What a wonderful samurai' she thought.

Opening her eyes she instead bore witness to its regenerative abilities, exhaling sharply in surprise.

She asked, eyes tracking the creature as it attempted to flank around.

Mizuki saw the claws coming in, her blade ringing out as it parried it's claws. However, the shock of her attacks being ineffective combined with its speed allowed it to rake her side.

She grunted as searing hot pain came from her hip, her hands gripping her sword tightly. She took a step back, readying herself for its next attack.

"Physical attacks only help it?" She said in disbelief, her gaze unwavering. "What's the plan Lily? You don't have long to decide."

The creature’s momentum slowed to zero, it was unable to move or take any actions.

She sighed. "As far as that one particular creature, Eva can take the frontline position from you, you will have to change to using basic aetherial attacks."

Her eyes widened a bit at the thought of using aetherial attacks. The sword was the only way she knew, and it took her years to become competent. Using magic seemed completely foreign to her!

The next morning, Lily went to the Inn's dining hall for breakfast and to meet with Mizuki, the place to her seemed more of a bar and Tavern than she was used to, perhaps the hunters and trappers in the area preferred it this way.

Seeing Lily already sat at a table, the samurai strode over and took her seat across from her, smiling warmly.

Lily placed a small, grimoire on the table, and opened it to a random page, filled with diagrams painted in a special ink.

The wound had healed up for the most part, although a bandage remained wrapped around her waist for good measure. Compared to yesterday, she could hardly even feel it.

Lily traced her finger on a shape. "Arcanistry, uses a person’s own aether to power the magic. It is altogether unlike the external magic that I normally employ, where I pull in surrounding aether."

"Which can be both more challenging to control, but also simpler in I just have to focus things sometimes."

Lily went on explaining for a time

]]Text 
"We as mortal beings, are very limited in our capacity for aether, we generally don’t have much, many types of beasts and creatures in the world far surpass us in this aspect."
]]Text
"However it does not take much aether to be damaging or efficient, it just requires one to be calculating and apply it carefully..."
]]Text
"Look to these shapes, if you pour your aether into it, the enchanted ink will focus your aether along specific paths, in specific directions and rotations and amplifications or attenuations."
]]Text
"After your aether completes the journey, the spell will appear. Focus your aether in this diagram, and a carbuncle should appear. Give it a try."
]]Portrait

Mizuki listened closely to her words, taking it all in as best she could. It was a lot all at once, but it all flowed together easily.

"I use my own life force to power the spells. How interesting." She thought to herself, pulling the book closer to her.

Reaching out Mizuki put a hand on the page, closing her eyes as she began to try and focus her aether onto the diagram.

Controlling her breathing she tried to channel her energy into the book, the finely drawn lines faintly glowing as it began to course through the diagram.

As she opened her eyes, the samurai looked to the ground beside her to spot a ruby carbuncle that she summoned. "It worked!"

Lily grinned, always fun to watch a new person figure it out. "In the truth of things, we don't actually require the enchanted ink to perform the magic, it is an aid."
]]Text
"The calculation is done ahead of time, and the method and result is recorded in the ink, all the user needs to do, is to understand the changing conditions of the area around them, and apply a minor adjustment”
]]Portrait
Lily_Poncho_Explain

"Here in this area, everything is relatively neutral so no adjustment is needed, but you will learn over time, if a spell fails, you need to adjust the flow of things manually to suit conditions."

Lily watched the carbuncle wander around. "The carbuncle spell was just an example, it won’t be helpful to us." Lily considered where to begin next for their journey, falling silent as she pondered.

]]Text 
"That sounds a lot harder than I'm sure it is, but I feel like I've got a better grasp on the whole thing." She says, reaching down to pet the carbuncle. 
]]Text
It was a shame that the spell wouldn't be any help, but it sure seemed like one of the safer spells to start out with. 
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Halfrobe_Standard
]]Text 
Better to do that than lose control of more destructive magic. She looked up to Lily once more. 
]]Text
"Then I suppose the next step would be to try and learn some spells that might help our mission? Something with a little more oomph to it?"
]]Portrait
Lily_Poncho_Standard
]]Text 
Lily's mind returned to the conversation. "Hmm, oh yes, you can learn the basic versions of a Bio spell, and a Ruin spell. Ruin is like a punch, but it attacks the targets aetherial being, which does result in damage."
]]Text
"Bio is similar to a poison, it just causes a disruption to the flow of aether inside a creature, but I want to go back to something I said, do you have your sword still?"

Lily returned her attention to Mizuki, "In any case, the aid is not limited to pages in books."

Mizuki perked up at the conversation at hand, Lily's words filling her with a bit of inspiration.

Mizuki nodded her head in understanding, taking her words to heart.

Lily looked to the window. "I am still restless about why the creatures remain in the cave." Watching the rainfall.

The rains continued for another few hours, the pair sat patiently while listening to the trappers talk about what game they would hunt that evening.

These were the types of voidsent she had heard about; abominations from a world alien to their own. "What exactly are they defending? A portal to their home world? A doomsday device?"

She drew her blade, holding it in front of her as she began to prepare a ruin spell aimed at one of the two. However, before she could release it an attack was made against them.

The glow from the sword shattered as Mizuki interrupted the process to retaliate. Petrify didn't sound like a spell that she wanted to get hit by, especially when the extraction of her soul was on the line.

Sighing, dutiful Eva as always, but they couldn’t run, they were trapped. She turned her attention to the horde in front of them. 
]]Text
"Allagan Blizzara", she casted an upgraded, area of effect version of her ice spell, placing a minor heavy effect on all the horde she caught in it.

Eva_Standard
]]Text 
Finishing its charge, Eva noticed the suddenly snared group, and changed its target at the last second, hitting every one of the snared creatures, inflicting heavy damage from the combo attack, and inflicting paralysis.
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Green_Alert
]]Text 
Mizuki glanced back after her first two attacks, watching as Lily and her node did a very effective combo attack on the large group of voidsent. 
]]Text
She wished she could do something to hit all of them at once, but for now she would just focus on the closest threat at hand. 
]]Text
Shifting her stance, she eyed the spider, charging up another ruin into her blade before attempting to cut across its eyes.
]]Portrait
Ilos
]]Text 
The gargoyle saw what was going on,  but he needed to complete the ritual to bring the Archmages souls over to inhabit the corpses. 
]]Text
Lily was the only one that could open a true portal, and the Archmages had the power to compel her to do so. "Fools, spread out into a formation!" 
]]Text
He wished he could bring real soldiers over that understood tactic, but it was too challenging to bring over powerful voidsent.

Lily_Poncho_Shout
]]Text
"Eva, distract the Chimera!" Lily shouted, she kept her attention focused on the horde, if she could do something about it now, they could better focus on a two on two. 
]]Text
"Allagan Thundara"! Lily was expending quite a bit of her mana into the task at hand. 
]]Text
If an observer looked closely, they might notice small streams of purplish black aether begin to escape her body, seemingly beyond her control. 
]]Portrait
Narrator
]]Text 
The Thundara spell hit dead center of the horde, crying and screaming sounds from the dying creatures filled the space as their souls were returned to the void.

Sibyl
]]Text 
The arachnid was nimble, and jumped back a few yalms to avoid the swipe. Then it saw Lily trying to cast against the horde. "Oh no you don’t mage! kekeke", 
]]Text
The Arachnid spat, and webbing flew towards Mizuki, with Lily behind her in the background which was her true target. "Tsk" It was frustrated its attack was too late to stop the Thundara spell.
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Green_Angry
]]Text 
Mizuki glared at the creature as it leapt out of the way of her attack, her blade just barely missing it. 
]]Text
She was much faster than the other voidsent, and she would have to pick up the speed. As the shot of web came in her direction, the samurai held up her sword in front of her, holding steady. 
]]Text
The webbing impacted and cut it down the middle, allowing it to pass by Mizuki. Following up she dashed forwards, attempting to move behind it and attack.

Eva_Standard
]]Text 
Following instructions, the node whirred, beeped, expanded in size and tackled Ilos at full speed. Breaking its concentration.
]]Portrait
Ilos
]]Text 
Frustrated. "Damned machine, begone!" It turned and began to attack Eva with its claws. 
]]Text
While there was an aetherial barrier preventing damage to the node, Ilos knew from ages long past when he battled similar contraptions, that once the machine ran out of aether the barriers would fall and the machine would break.

Lily_Poncho_Standard
]]Text 
Lily turned her attention to the ritual, she could disrupt it easy enough now she thought. 
]]Text
She pointed her staff in that direction and began to channel some of the darkness residing in her soul, to destroy the ritual... when at that moment, some webbing flew past her in two halves, 
]]Text
Some passed harmlessly behind her, while the other in her front caught her arm and staff, binding her. She screamed. "Aaaaack, I’m stuck!"
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Green_Alert
]]Text 
Mizuki looked over at Lily as she screamed out, seeing part of her had been caught up in the web. 
]]Text
The only problem was that she was now behind the big spider, cutting them off from one another. Reaching onto her waist, she pulled out a small ceremonial dagger she kept with her. 
]]Text
It hasn't seen much action, and certainly wouldn't help with killing anything, but it would have to do for now. "Lily, here!" She called out, taking the knife and kicking it over to her. "Cut yourself free!"
]]Portrait
Lily_Poncho_Standard
]]Text 
Lily picked up the dagger as it slid next to her foot, after a brief struggle and ruining her poncho, she did free her arm. She noticed Eva would not last much longer against the Chimera. 
]]Text
Thinking fast, she decided to use the Polyglot she built up, to aid Mizuki. "So much for the rest of my aether... Allagan Xenoglossy" 
]]Text
A deafening boom was heard as she opened a microscopic tear in the world, inside Sibyl’s innards, a portal to the aetherial sea between worlds. 
]]Text
The spider shuddered in pain, then died silently once the spell was finished. Lily was left with previous little mana to take any action except disrupt the ritual now. 
]]Text
"Mizuki, you must deal with the Chimera now while I deal with the ritual"
]]Portrait
Mizuki_Green_Alert
]]Text 
Mizuki covered a horn as the boom rang out in the room, shaking her bones around like it was cast on her. 
]]Text
However, it did the trick as the spider fell dead before her. She regrouped momentarily with Lily, giving her torn poncho a sad look. "I'll buy you a new one." 
]]Text
She says, hopping down into the ritual area to take out the chimera. "Long time no see." She says to Ilos, her sword glowing with aether as she imbued a bio spell into it and preparing to attack.
]]Portrait
Lily_Poncho_Tired
]]Text 
Lily looked at the situation, she saw her chance, and released the darkness energies from within her to disrupt the portal. 
]]Text
She fell exhausted to the ground in that moment, but her task was completed. "Good... luck... Mizuki..."
